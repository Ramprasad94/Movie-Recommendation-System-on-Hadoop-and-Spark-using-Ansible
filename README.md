A repository containing code for the implementation of Movie Recommendation System on Hadoop and Spark using Ansible

Description
The rapid rise of the World Wide Web and online entertainment delivery systems have led to a massive influx of data from various sources. While arts and entertainment were confined to offline access and consumption for the better part of the 20th century, over the past few decades it has evolved into something much more scalable. Fuelled by the growth in technology, movie sites such as Netflix have been at the forefront of content delivery systems.

Hadoop, Spark and other such big data processing frameworks have been helpful in crunching numbers for data intensive operations and deliver results as and when required. One such application which has been implemented through this project is the Movie Recommendation system.

A movie recommendation system scans the data accumulated over a period of years and recommends an unseen movie to a user who has similar tastes to users who have already seen the movie in question.

In our project, we have implemented a Movie Recommendation System using both Hadoop and Spark and tried to make a comparison between the two. We actually ran our code on ‘big’ data. We built a recommendation list by analyzing 10 Million ratings using Hadoop. We also analyzed 1 Million movie ratings on both Hadoop and Spark for the sake of comparison. The project uses Hadoop to run the MapReduce jobs on a set of virtual clusters on Future Systems, based on OpenStack. Python programming language was used to perform the map and reduce functions on a MovieLens dataset, taken from grouplens.org.
